## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Matias!

I'm a Computer Scientist with a BSc, MSc, and PhD from the [National University of CÃ³rdoba](https://www.unc.edu.ar), Argentina, where I also serve as a professor in the Computer Science department. I've been teaching Computer Science and Data Science for over 10 years, and I have a passion for working in data-driven, cross-functional teams.

Currently, I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at [INESCTEC](https://www.inesctec.pt) and the [University of Porto](https://www.up.pt), contributing to the [Emeritus project](https://emeritusproject.eu).

I'm always eager to get involved in innovative business projects and initiatives in education. When working on new projects, I thrive on taking on a wide range of tasks beyond the technical and scientific aspects, focusing on enhancing team and organizational efficiency.

Feel free to reach outâ€”I'm always happy to connect with curious minds and expand my network! âœ¨
